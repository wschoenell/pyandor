# Introduction #

I have only tested this on Linux machines. You must have the Andor's Linux SDK installed. The modules assumes that the kernel driver is installed at '/usr/local/lib/libandor.so'. Modify that in andor.py if necessary.

The actual module is andor.py. There is a small example on how to use it 'simple\_example.py'. There is also another more useful example with a simple text menu in 'camera.py'. Currently there is no documentation for this module but if I found that there is reasonable interest in this project I shall make one!
