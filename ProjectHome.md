This is a small Python wrapping for Andor's camera to enable you to easily script these cameras without the hassle of compiling your programs. It tries to stick to the same function naming that Andor uses. Therefore it should be fairly trivial how to use it. The module is object oriented and keeps some information inside the class such as gain, preampgain, gainRange etc.


Note: This project is not affiliated with Andor in any way.
